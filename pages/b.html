                    My previous school was <a href="https://www.akademiet.no/vgs/skolesteder/heltberg-bislett/">Heltberg vgs</a>, and before that, I attended <a href="https://www.akademiet.no/vgs/skolesteder/heltberg-bislett/">Akademiet</a> for 1 year, <br> 
                    making a total of 3 years. In vg1, I took IT2, and in vg2, I studied IT1—kind of a reverse progression, haha. <br> 
                    Throughout these 3 years, I had the opportunity to meet wonderful mentors (teachers from Heltberg) who taught me how to independently study subjects of interest.

                    My previous school was <a href="https://hersleb.vgs.no/">Hersleb vgs</a> I had four subjects at Hersleb vgs theese subjects were Norwegian, history, science and maths. <br>
                    Theese subjects were interesting and the teachers were great and I learned a lot. I am looking forward to learn programming and design.

                    My previous school was <a href="https://viken.no/rud-vgs/"> Rud vgs</a> I useed to have a makerspace at my school were i spent countless hours at haha.
                    During my first year (VG1), I designed and built a tabletop arcade. In my second year (VG2), I attempted to create a game engine using C++. In hindsight, I can only laugh at how poorly it turned out. <br>
                    I am looking forward to study at Oslomet and all the subjects we are going to learn and all the professors and students i will meet :D.
